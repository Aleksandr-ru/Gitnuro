# Gitnuro

A FOSS Git client based on (Jetbrains) Compose and JGit.

The main goal of Gitnuro is to provide a multiplatform open source Git client without any kind of constraint to how you can use it nor relying on web technologies.

The project it is still in alpha and many feature are lacking or missing, but it's somewhat usable for basic usage. 

Feel free to open issues for bugs or sugestions.
